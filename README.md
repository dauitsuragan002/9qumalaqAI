# [Togyz Qumalaq AI](https://togyz-qumalaq-ai.vercel.app/)
This project was inspired by the TV series "–†–µ–≤–∞–Ω—à" (Revansh), where artificial intelligence challenges humans in chess. In the current era of rapid AI development, we decided to bring this concept to our national game - Togyz Qumalaq. Just as AI has made significant strides in chess, we believe it's time to explore the possibilities of AI in traditional Kazakh board games.
